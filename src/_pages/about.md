# What is Sanus artificium anyway &#8230;

So what is the name mean?

> SANUS (*Latin*) sound, ARTIFICIUM (*Latin*) craft work

The idea for this name came from nowhere and it indicates nothing as it probably should because sanus artificium is a bunch of projects brought together and presented in this web site. Most of them music or sound related &#8211; thus the &#8220;sanus&#8221; in the name.

Many of project files are freely available for download and use from their respective areas. As music compositions can be found at [Music][2] page, virtual synthesizer plug-ins can be found at [VST instruments][3] page, virtual effect plug-ins can be found at [VST effects][3] page, PHP and other scripts at [PHP scripts][4] page, graphic elements at [Graphics][5] page ans so on.

# Note

Downloads in this site mostlly come compressed in .zip containers for space saving, if you need any de-compression software here are several to choose from &#8211; [7-zip][6], [iZarc][7], [WinZip][8], [WinRar][9].

Licenses and read-me files mostlly come in .pdf format so you will need [adobe reader][10].

Have fun,

**Sasha Khamkov**
