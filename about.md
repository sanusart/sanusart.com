My name is Sasha.

I was born November 23th,1980 in former USSR republic of Belarus and at age 11 successfully immigrated to Israel with my [family](/photos/).

I am older between two brothers.

At August 28th, 2008 I’ve married my high-school sweetheart Katy and we both live happily in Jerusalem, Israel. At June of 2011 we had addition to our little family – our wonderful daughter Emily was born.

Sound engineer by profession but my other big passion is web and currently my main day job is web applications designer and developer.
