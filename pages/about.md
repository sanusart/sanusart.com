# Small, brief biography

![sasha](/uploads/sasha.jpg)

Although there are a lot of &#8220;we&#8221; and &#8220;us&#8221; on this website as you might notices (or not), Sanus artificium is an one person project.

My name is Sasha Khamkov (sometimes Alex, Alexander or whatever this [name][1] is aliasing to &#8211; I don&#8217;t mind really). I was born November 23th,1980 in former USSR republic of Belarus and at age 11 successfully immigrated to Israel with my family. I am older between two brothers.

At August 28th, 2008 I&#8217;ve married my high-school sweetheart Katy and we both live happily in Jerusalem, Israel. At June of 2011 we had addition to our little family &#8211; our wonderful daughter Emily was born.

Sound engineer by profession but my other big passion is web and currently my main day job is web applications designer and developer.

# What is Sanus artificium anyway &#8230;

So what is the name mean? &#8211; NOTHING !!!

SANUS &#8211; (*Latin*) sound, ARTIFICIUM &#8211; (*Latin*) craft work.

The idea for this name came from nowhere and it indicates nothing as it should because sanus artificium is a bunch of projects brought together and presented in this web site. Most of them music or sound related &#8211; thus the &#8220;sanus&#8221; in the name.
